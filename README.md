Written by Ndimangwa Fadhili Ngoya

it is just a min-platform like Django, Next.js etc

JUST run 

php build.php --help

Example :
php build.php --init init --target html --schema templates/system.csv 


Your code will be in html folder [ The schema is where the plan of your code resides ]
You also need to update config.php in the root folder to match your database configuration. Default database MySQL
