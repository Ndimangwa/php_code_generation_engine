THIS MANUAL ASSUMES YOU HAVE A BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF DATABASE, COPY FILES BETWEEN 
TWO OR MORE MACHINES CONNECTED VIA COMPUTER NETWORK

Contents [ This manual assumes you are using linux, if your are running any other 
operating system, you will do accordingly, and the paths can be different from machine to machine ]
1. Pulling new Version of the system
2. Generating your system code
3. Pushing new System to the server
4. Configuring server to run on the new code 

1. Pulling new Version of the system [ from git repository to your local machine ]
Step 1: Open Terminal or Command Prompt 
Step 2: Switch to the home directory of the system (zoomtong.devel)
        Command : cd /var/www/html/zoomtong.devel/
Step 3: Run the gits Commands [ in case of password : QggdfvXTNSCvsV4PTnhk ]
        Command : git fetch origin master
        Command : git reset --hard origin/master


2. Updating your system code
Step 1: You need to generate the system
    Command : php build.php --init init --target html --schema templates/system.csv
    Command : cd html 
Step 2: Update your datapase
    2.1 : Read Database Configurations 
        Command : cat config.php
    2.2 : Remove old database from mysql database 
    2.3 : Reistall a new database 
        Command : mysql -u [username] -h [localhost] [database-name] -p < sql/__init_db.sql 
        Command : mysql -u [username] -h [localhost] [database-name] -p < additionalSQL/addsql.sql 
    2.4 : Test the system 
        Web: localhost/zoomtong.devel/html 

3. Pushing new System to the server [ at hospital  make sure 192.168.8.2 is reachable from your laptop ]
    [ Server path is /var/www/html/ ]
Step 1: Move back to /var/www/zoomtong.devel in your machine
    Command : cd .. 
Step 2: Copy html folder to server [ you can use WinSCP in case of Windows ] 
    [ Server password : mbwambo@2021 ]
    Command : scp -r html mbwambo@192.168.8.2:/var/www/html/hmis 
Step 3 : Logon to the server [ you can use putty in Windows ]
    [ Server password : mbwambo@2021 ]
    Command : ssh mbwambo@192.168.8.2
Step 4 : Go to the system folder 
    Command : cd /var/www/html/hmis 
Step 5 : Restore Configurations 
    Command : cp ../config.php .
Step 6 : View configurations 
    Command : cat config.php 


4. Configuring Server to run new Code 
Step 1 : You need to backup the mysql database  [ use mysqldump ]

Step 3 : You need to copy a new database [ You can refer no 2 above Updating your system code , Step 2 Update your database ]
Step 4 : Test your code 
    Web : 192.168.8.2/hmis
